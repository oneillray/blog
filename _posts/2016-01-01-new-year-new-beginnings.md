2015 a year of major highs and lows. It was far the most part, a year of consuming content rather than creating it. This blog is an effort to change that. Over the next year, and hopefully years to come i will use this a testing ground for ideas, experiements, thoughts and general things that interest me. If anything it will allow for me to be for mindful of the content that I consume and document what I learn.
